## 10/17/2025 - gathered a materials list  

We need an ESP32 board, a BME280 sensor, a solar panel + battery set, breadboard + wires for prototyping, and a proper box for all of this. Considering adding more sensors like a camera, etc. Currently researching how to get an ESP32 to host webserver. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjc0MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f54a612f8f1453403689cf02d5b23a3c8897a1c5/image.png)
  

## 10/26/2025 - CADed the box and Xiao casing  

I CADed the box that goes around all the internal circuit components, as well as the casing for the Xiao sense ESP32 board, which includes a heatsink holder, since the Xiao will get hot under the heavy AI loads we're going to put it through.
